What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Working through the assignment methodically worked really well for me and helped me to keep my logic organized. Along the way, I ran into some syntax errors and a logical error with checking for the computer in inventory before the computer had been added. I would recommend that future students make sure to organize their thinking and really take their time on this assignment.
